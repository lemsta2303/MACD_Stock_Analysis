# MACD Stock Analysis in Python

## Project Description

This Python project implements the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) stock analysis indicator. The project calculates MACD and signal lines based on historical stock data and identifies buy/sell signals. It also simulates a basic trading strategy based on these signals and tracks the account balance over time.

Key components include:
- **MACD Calculation**: Using 12-day and 26-day EMA.
- **Signal Line**: 9-day EMA of the MACD line.
- **Buy/Sell Signal Detection**: Identifying points of MACD and signal line intersection.
- **Trading Simulation**: Simulating trades based on buy/sell signals and tracking account performance.

## Skills Developed
- **Data Analysis with Pandas**
- **Algorithm Implementation**
- **Plotting with Matplotlib**
- **Simulation of Trading Strategies**
